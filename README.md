# Library Management System (LMS)

## Project Overview

The **Library Management System (LMS)** is a Java-based desktop application built with Java Swing for managing library resources and operations effectively. It uses **MySQL** as the database to store and organize information, making it easy for librarians and library staff to manage books, borrowers, and transactions. This system is designed to streamline library operations, providing an easy-to-use interface for managing books, tracking issued/returned books, and handling borrower information.
